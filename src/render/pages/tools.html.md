# Tools

Here are some useful tools I like to recommend. 

  * [Sublime Text 2, a great text editor!](http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/) \- 
  * [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) \- A great universal zip archiver
  * [Recuva](http://www.recuva.com/) \- This program recovers data that you have deleted
  * [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) \- Keeps control of all your passwords, safe!
  * [JDiskreport](http://www.jgoodies.com/) \- Where has all that space gone? Great for finding big and unwanted files.
  * [GhostDoc](http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc/) \- Helps you commenting your .net code.
  * [IcoFX](http://icofx.xhost.ro/) \- Need to retouch that favicon of yours? IcoFX is for you.
  * [Fiddler2 ](http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/)\- Great to understand, optimize and customize http requests.
  * [KDE Mover-Sizer](http://corz.org/windows/software/accessories/KDE-resizing-moving-for-XP-or-Vista.php) \- Program to get the same kind of window movement and resizing that you find in KDE, but for windows.
