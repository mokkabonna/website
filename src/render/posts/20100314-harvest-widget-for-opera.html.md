# Harvest time tracking widget for Opera

I've made a Opera widget that connects to [Harvest](http://getharvest.com), a time tracking/invoicing service which is great. The widget is built using only HTML/CSS/Javascript(jQuery) and since I only need to support Opera, I have used technologies like web databases, rounded CSS corners, box shadow etc. Also nice to have the ability to use CSS selectors like :last-of-type to make things easier. ![](../images/screenshot.png)
