# Text selection mode off in opera

A nice feature in opera is to turn off text selection when dragging on the web page. For instance when using opera on an iPad over remote desktop to your pc. This allows you to drag the page as you would in the native browser on the iPad. 

To enable this, right click any toolbar and press `customize - apperance - buttons - browser view`. Then drag the button "text selection on" to any toolbar of your choice. Then whenever you want to activate the mode, click the button.
