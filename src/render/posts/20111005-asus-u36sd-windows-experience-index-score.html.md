# ASUS U36SD windows experience index score

After getting my new laptop, an ASUS U36SD, weighting only 1,7 KG, replacing the HDD with an SSD and upgrading the RAM to 8 GB (I can't believe how cheap ram is these days.) I ran the windows experience index test. These are the results I came up with. ![](../images/experience.png) I think that is pretty good for a laptop of this size and price.
