# Dragging and resizing windows easily

My absolute favourite feature of KDE on linux is the ability to move a window by holding down the Alt button and left-clicking ANYWHERE in the window, and also to hold down Alt and the right-click to easily resize the window. (Why do we need huge window edges MS?) These features I really miss on windows, but I finally found a small program that makes that possible on windows. It has the awesome name of [KDE Mover-Sizer](http://corz.org/windows/software/accessories/KDE-resizing-moving-for-XP-or-Vista.php) :P Enjoy!
